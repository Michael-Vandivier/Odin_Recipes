# Odin_Recipes

This is a small website, being built one step at a time.

Main goals are as follows:
Interact with Git and the command line interface.
Interact with Github, becoming familiar with cloning a repository, adding working towards atomic commits(Small meaningful changes), and pushing them back to the repository.

This will be done by creating a main page(index.html) and incrementally adding more content until additional pages are added with their required content.
